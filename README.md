Battleships (2010)
===========

Battleships is a C# Windows Console implementation of the well-known board game. It was produced as an assessed piece of coursework during my first semester at University, gaining a mark of 82.

Game Modes
--------------
Battleships features 3 games modes; test, single player, and multiplayer mode. Test mode doesn't hide where the CPU places its ships (debug), single player hides them (the real game), whilst multiplayer adds another sea so you can take on the computer (if you think you're tough enough).

To select a game mode, type the number shown next to the mode (e.g. type “2” to enter Single Player Mode) when prompted by the above message.

Message Bar
--------------
It features a message bar that helps you throughout the game. Errors will show up here, as well as your opponent's speech. When shooting at ships, a green message bar means you've hit an opponent's ship, whilst a yellow one means you've missed.

Interface
--------------
Each board printed shows the state of each sea square. The coordinates you type in run along the top & sides.

Yellow text means there is an choice for you to make

Red text means you’ve made a little mistake. No worries though, you’ll get another go.
